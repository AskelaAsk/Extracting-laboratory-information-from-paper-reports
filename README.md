This code demonstrates the data digitization algorithm on a pre-trained model.

Human health is one of the most important aspects of his life, and modern medical advances play a key role in providing quality medical care. Modern development of personalized medicine requires effective management of medical information. The most important aspect of this process is the availability of digitized analyzes presented in a single form, which allows you to track the dynamics of changes in indicators.

The goal of my work is to create a unified system for digitizing and analyzing laboratory research. Key objectives include developing an optical data search (ODS) module to identify text in scanned reports and creating an information extraction (IE) module to convert text into structured, standardized data.
